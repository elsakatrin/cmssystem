CMS System guide in module 6.

For this project I used this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeD31HHsREg&ab_channel=HamedBahram and this text tutorial along side it https://www.hamedbahram.io/notes/prismic#. 
I recommend this tutorial, it was easy to follow and in the video he explains everything very well.
I ran into some errors, especially with linking the page to the homepage using PrismicLink. Ran into some more errors aswell so this guide took a little more time than I planned. 
I really like the idea of using Prismic and Slice machine even though I got all these errors. I want to gain a better understanding of it because I feel it's a really cool way to make websites for clients that can edit the content themselves.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
